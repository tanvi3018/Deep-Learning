Deep Learning with TensorFlow
Purpose

The Deep Learning with TensorFlow project focuses on building, training, and evaluating deep learning models using TensorFlow. This project is designed to explore various neural network architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Fully Connected Networks (FCNs), to solve complex tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and more. The goal is to leverage the power of deep learning to achieve high performance on these tasks.
How to Run

To run the project, follow these steps:

    Clone the Repository:

    sh

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Deep_Learning_with_TensorFlow.git
cd Deep_Learning_with_TensorFlow

Install the Dependencies:
Ensure that you have Python installed (preferably version 3.7 or above). Then, install the necessary Python packages:

sh

pip install -r requirements.txt

Prepare the Data:
Ensure your dataset is correctly formatted and located in the expected directory. You may need to modify the data_loader.py script to load and preprocess your data according to the specific requirements of the project.

Run the Main Script:
Execute the main script to train and evaluate the deep learning models:

sh

    python deep_learning_with_tensorflow/main.py

    View Results:
    The script will output performance metrics, including accuracy, loss, and possibly visualizations like learning curves and confusion matrices. These results will help you assess the effectiveness of the models and identify areas for further improvement.

Dependencies

The project relies on several Python libraries, which are specified in the requirements.txt file. Key dependencies include:

    tensorflow: The primary library for building and training deep learning models.
    pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    numpy: For numerical computations and handling arrays.
    scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and evaluation metrics.
    matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing results.
    seaborn: For advanced data visualization.

To install these dependencies, use the following command:

sh

pip install -r requirements.txt
